How it works?

Let noOfRows = 5 and value = 1.

1st iteration :

for i = 1

for j = 1

Print value  –>  Print 1

value++  –>  value = 2

for j = 2

As j > i

break inner for loop

Go To Next Line

After 1st iteration, output will be,

?
1
1
2nd iteration :

for i = 2

for j = 1

Print value  –>  Print 2

value++  –>  value = 3

for j = 2

Print value  –>  Print 3

value++  –>  value = 4

for j = 3

As j > i

break inner for loop

Go To Next Line

After 2nd iteration, output will look like below,

?
1
2
1   
2    3   
3rd iteration :

for i = 3

for j = 1

Print value  –>  Print 4

value++  –>  value = 5

for j = 2

Print value  –>  Print 5

value++  –>  value = 6

for j = 3

Print value  –>  Print 6


 
value++  –>  value = 7

for j = 4

As j > i

break inner for loop

Go To Next Line

After 3rd iteration, output will be,

?
1
2
3
1   
2    3   
4    5    6   
4th iteration :

for i = 4

for j = 1

Print value  –>  Print 7

value++  –>  value = 8

for j = 2

Print value  –>  Print 8

value++  –>  value = 9

for j = 3

Print value  –>  Print 9

value++  –>  value = 10

for j = 4

Print value  –>  Print 10

value++  –>  value = 11

for j = 5

As j > i

break inner for loop

Go To Next Line

After 4th iteration, output will be,

?
1
2
3
4
1   
2    3   
4    5    6   
7    8    9    10   
5th iteration :

for i = 5

for j = 1

Print value  –>  Print 11

value++  –>  value = 12

for j = 2

Print value  –>  Print 12

value++  –>  value = 13

for j = 3

Print value  –>  Print 13

value++  –>  value = 14

for j = 4

Print value  –>  Print 14

value++  –>  value = 15

for j = 5

Print value  –>  Print 15

value++  –>  value = 16

for j = 6

As j > i

break inner for loop

Go To Next Line

After 5th iteration, output will be,

?
1
2
3
4
5
1   
2    3   
4    5    6   
7    8    9    10   
11   12   13   14   15   
6th Iteration :

for i = 6

As i > noOfRows

Break outer for loop

Final Output :

?
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
